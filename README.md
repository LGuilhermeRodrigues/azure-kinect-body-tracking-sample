# Copy of Sample Unity Body Tracking Application

Copied from https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Samples/tree/master/body-tracking-samples/sample_unity_bodytracking

Major changes:
- Files to be moved (I think cufft64_10.dll is missing in the official repository)
- Default TrackerProcessingMode is set Cpu, if you have a GPU, please change in SkeletalTrackingProvider.cs line 46
- I am working in a new scene with another avatar

### Directions for getting started:


#### 1) First get the latest nuget packages of libraries:

Open the sample_unity_bodytracking project in Unity.
Open the Visual Studio Solution associated with this project.
If there is no Visual Studio Solution yet you can make one by opening the Unity Editor
and selecting one of the csharp files in the project and opening it for editing.
You may also need to set the preferences->External Tools to Visual Studio

In Visual Studio:
Select Tools->NuGet Package Manager-> Package Manager Console

On the command line of the console at type the following command:

Update-Package -reinstall

The latest libraries will be put in the Packages folder under sample_unity_bodytracking


#### 2) Next download the latest Body Tracking Package

Go to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/body-sdk-download and follow the directions to install the sdk for version  1.1.0

The default location for the SDK is:   C:\Program Files\Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK

**You can download the SDK wherever you like but you will then need to update the paths in the MoveLibraryFiles.bat file**

set BODY_TRACKING_SDK_PATH="YOUR PATH HERE"


#### 3) Next add these libraries to the Assets/Plugins folder:

You can do this by hand or use the batch file MoveLibraryFile.bat to automatically move the libraries
